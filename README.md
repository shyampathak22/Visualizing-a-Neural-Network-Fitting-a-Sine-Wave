# Visualizing-a-Neural-Network-Fitting-a-Sine-Wave
This program is a simple neural network that has the ability to take a random input of points on a (x, y) coordinate graph and fit them to a line, all the while providing a visual of the progress of its learning. It was tested using a simple sine wave. It was written for two main purposes. The first was to be used as an exploration into TensorFlow and Keras and the usages and capabilities of a simple neural network. The second purpose was to create a method in which somone with no knowledge of neural networks could see the process and progress of the neural network learning. This program accomplishes both things. The visualization will show the progress of the networks learning and fitting of the sine wave. This can, theoretically, be applied to any mathematical function using just this program. The parameters would need to be changed, and if using a function not suppported by numpy, the input of the data would need to be altered as well.
